skipping search for quality of pattern, if the success rate is not positive in last 20 hits (good for both considering the most recent results and the consistency)


A simple strategy- 
  trend-based
		-recognising the trend
		-entry point
		-sl/tp
		-exit/trailing stops
		-end of trend detection

H2 is highly correlated with L1. so, meeting both conditions L1 low and H1 high is unrealistic
Hence, lower L1 encourages lower H2. As a result, working on L1 entry is not a good idea.
Also, I remember that close is not predictable.
Maybe, the only realistic idea is open price then sl and tp on H1 and L1

simulation on open prices is suitable only if you want to open/close by EA; if sl and tp are hit at the same bar, it won't work
