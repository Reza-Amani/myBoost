Median as the input gives a higher swing and smoother RSI than close price.
period opter:
   -target: minimising drawbacks between 30 and 70
      -worse: complete return
      -less bad: short bounce
   -by: 
      -try to push the drawback beyond 70 limit (lower period); if it is above 60
      -try to fade it (higher period); if it is below 60
   -reset the period opter on every tick, or tune it gradually(more logical)?
the EA:
   -buy only at cross +30
   -close at:
       -red RSI above 70
       -2 red RSI bars above 50
       -return to under 30 if below 50
   -uses period opter
   -with the permision from officer
the officer:
   -should determine useless, side-going, non-swinging dynamics
   -advanced: adjusts 30 level (for buy entry) based on trend; for both EA and period opter
















Pattern correlation notes:

H1/L1 are well predicted. But they are tight to C0, i.e. useless. In ther words, this is C0 that is predicted and then next bar H&L are symmetric around high and low of C0.

A simple strategy- 
  trend-based
		-recognising the trend
		-entry point
		-sl/tp
		-exit/trailing stops
		-end of trend detection

H2 is highly correlated with L1. so, meeting both conditions L1 low and H1 high is unrealistic
Hence, lower L1 encourages lower H2. As a result, working on L1 entry is not a good idea.
Also, I remember that close is not predictable.
Maybe, the only realistic idea is open price then sl and tp on H1 and L1

simulation on open prices is suitable only if you want to open/close by EA; if sl and tp are hit at the same bar, it won't work
