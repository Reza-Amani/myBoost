No of consecutive bars [1..5]
(last) bar size [2]
bar shape[2]

long and short filters for any of [5][2][2]

A threshold (+/-) is needed for filters, not 0


The relation between stat and the destribution of 1's and -1's:

No.of.1's/No.of.-1's = (1+s)/(1-s)

So, 0.1(10)-> 1.22 (22% more, or 55%-45%)
    0.2(20)-> 1.5  (50% more, or 60%-40%)
