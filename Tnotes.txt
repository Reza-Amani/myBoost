+1a. Denoising. 3 samples? not too long please
     1.aa. LATER: Smart Denoise, so that in sharp movements in straight direction, follow the last price (or increase its weight) rather than staying behind
     1.ab. My own RSI: some of +diffs / total abs of diffs, for len bars
  1b. Indicator of diff of denoise and price
     1c. LATER, Extracting next price from denoise if predicted

2a. Pred(RSI) as analog
  2b. Indicator of diff(Pred(RSI)) vs diff(denoise)
  2c. Identify effective parameters to align those diffs and make a positive correlation
  2d. narrow them down, and determine the way they effect
  2e. MOSTAHAB: practice, if RSI is in track

3a. Pred(MACD) as analog
  3b. Indicator of diff(Pred(MACD)) vs diff(denoise)
  3c. Identify effective parameters to align those diffs and make a positive correlation
  3d. narrow them down, and determine the way they effect
  3e. MOSTAHAB: practice, if MACD is in track

4a. Pred(RSI_MACD)
  4b. Indicator of diff(Pred(RSI_MACD)) vs diff(denoise)
  4c. Is it in track? try EA with go/nogo approach
  4c. decide if it is possible to adjust RSI and MACD separately (weights as well), or all should be together
     4ca. an idea of adjusting: when the peak happens
  4d. Full adjustment and controller EA
