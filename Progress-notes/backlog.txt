+  considering the deadtime of history bars in tester history
+  autocorrelation: correl(j2:j1000,j3;j1001) first try on M5 and H1 under no profit: no colrrelation.
+  debug/assessments and execution
=> making sure that correlation calculation and report are working fine, after recent reforms
   definition of trade strategy quality
+  pre-assessment; not beneficial; further checks might be needed
...   investigating on best len; fixed pattern len
...   investigating on best correlation thresh; fixed pattern len
   trying different len's on each bar
   trying different correl-thresh's on each len, each bar
... investigating on valueablity of volume
