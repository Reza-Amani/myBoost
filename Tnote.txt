Adaptive RSI len: 
	25 35 50
	on ind, quality bars, updated just after detecting and recording the peak
	quality: avregae of swing on 3 (var) peak pairs
	in EA, for close, check rsi1-rsi2 rather than rsi1-peak
	check the best RSI len and apply on the same tick
	what if only one of RSI's has updated? last peak to use in the average is the last RSI samples, which makes it analog and smooth

	adaptive TP: when slope of RSI is low, reduce TP factor to 0.5

set of 44 4 40 2 is positive over 3 currencies in H1 in 2years
=max of RSI over a period can overwrite A0; Not too sure!

=tidying up extras
=investigate on standard vs ECN
=what to do if SAR isn't inline with RSI
=After a sharp jump, either no trade or take a higher SAR step and tighter tp
speeding the indicator up
testing different RSI_len's to catch the biggest swing (A to V)
If the time-difference between peak is short, trying shorter time period
