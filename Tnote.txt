Adaptive RSI len: 
	25 35 50
	on ind, quality bars, updated just after detecting and recording the peak
	quality: avregae of swing on 3 (var) peak pairs
	in EA, for close, check rsi1-rsi2 rather than rsi1-peak
	check the best RSI len and apply on the same tick
	what if only one of RSI's has updated?

set of 44 4 40 2 is positive over 3 currencies in H1 in 2years
=max of RSI over a period can overwrite A0; Not too sure!

=tidying up extras
=investigate on standard vs ECN
=what to do if SAR isn't inline with RSI
=After a sharp jump, either no trade or take a higher SAR step and tighter tp
speeding the indicator up
testing different RSI_len's to catch the biggest swing (A to V)
If the time-difference between peak is short, trying shorter time period
